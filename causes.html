            <h2>Generating Power</h2>

            <h4>Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas causes a large chunk of global emissions. Most electricity is still produced from fossil fuels; only about a quarter comes from wind, solar, and other renewable sources.</h4>

              <h2>Manufacturing Goods</h2>

              <h4>Manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes, and other goods. Mining and other industrial processes also release gases.</h4>

            <h2>Cutting Down Forests</h2>

            <h4>Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they are cut, release the carbon they have been storing. Since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits natureâ€™s ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere.</h4>
